# Basics

# Write a method that takes someone's order

# Call the method

return_value = def order(food)
  puts "That's one #{food}, please!"
end

# value = if true
#   8
# else
#   9
# end

# puts value

# order('pizza')
# puts return_value.inspect
send(return_value, 'pizza')


# Question:
# Can I assign it to a variable as a method? Why would I want to do this?



# def takesAWhile
  puts 'starting'
  sleep(3)
  puts 'ending'
# end

# takesAWhile
