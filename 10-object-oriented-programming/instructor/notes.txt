Advantages of Objects

1) Encapsulation
  - Classify Concepts

2) Information Hiding
  - State is "private" by default
  - Must invoke behaviour to access state
  - Invoke a behaviour by "passing a message"
  - NoMethodError if object doesn't know how to do it

3) Abstraction
  - Internal of the object is irrelevant

- Instances can evolve independently

Things to Memorize/Understand:

  - Difference between a Class and an Instance
  - What is an "Instance Variable"
